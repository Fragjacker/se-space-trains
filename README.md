# Factorio SE Space Trains
This is the repository for my [SE Space Train](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/se-space-trains) mod to be used best in conjunction with [Space Exloration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration) and [Krastorio 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2).

> [!NOTE]
> This mod can be also used in vanilla only but the ability to actually build trains in space with the appropriate space rails is only provided when using the Space Exloration mod.
