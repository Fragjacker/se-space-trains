[mod-description]
se-space-trains=This mod adds UPS friendly Space Exploration themed, MAGLEV propulsed, trains. They are best used together with the Krastorio 2 and Space Exploration mod.n\ Yet, they also function as standalone pack, using only the vanilla base game.n\ This is however now also fully compatible with Space Age and Elevated Rails.
